# CyFi

We apply Cortex's on-chain AI technology to build an automated DeFi portfolio allocation tool for users, taking into account different DeFi protocols' current yield, expected yield, degree of centralization, liquidity, collateral, trustworthiness and other features.


 We will include more crypto assets and data points from different protocols in our portfolio to strengthen the robo-advisor model and provide the best ROI possible in the market. As we collect more transactional data from the market, we will continuously  work on other mathematical based defi models such as credit report, crypto credit lending, and AI governance
